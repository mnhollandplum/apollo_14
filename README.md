## Be sure to read all user stories BEFORE beginning your work

## Setup

- Perform the usual setup steps after cloning a Rails application (`bundle install`, `bundle update`, `rake db:{drop,create,migrate}` etc)

## Requirements

- TDD all new work; you may postpone model tests for attribute validations only

## Not Required

- No form input is required
- No visual styling is required

## Before Starting User Stories
- You will have 4 failing model tests. (Let an instructor know if you are not seeing 4 failing tests)
- Get these 4 tests to pass **before** moving on to the user stories.
